# My First Steps to the Data Science


In this Post, I will share how I started my journey as Data Scientist, despite not working as a scientist yet, but I already use all the tools and techniques in my day, and this has helped a lot.


I would like to point out that, it is not a step by step to become a scientist, but rather the path that I chose to try to reach my goals.

Let's go !

### Google... 

You probably have already done this, but searching in different and reliable sources is a good start, the internet is full of information on the subject with diverse experiences and great articles on the subject, such as academic Google.

### A good book...

There are several books on the subject with reliable information at an affordable price. If it is not possible to have a professional in the field near you to share experiences, a good book on data science can help. One thing I do is access the bibliography of an article on the topic to find books, if the book was good for those who wrote the article, it can be good for me too.

### You Tube ... 

I love it, several and several videos on the same subject with professionals who explain the same problem and its solutions in different ways. What I always do is search for a subject that I read on a blog or book and watch videos with different thoughts to fix in my memory. Just be careful, there are a lot of people who don't know anything giving an opinion.

### Curiosity ... 

Data science has a lot to do with searching and investigating ... Curiosity is fundamental for a good analysis. So don't feel constrained by being curious, in that area the more questions you ask the better.

### People ... 

Stick with those who know how to work, absorb as much as you can of good professionals, don't be ashamed to ask and “when a door closes”, look for another one.

### Courses ... 

After a lot of research, feeling prepared to invest in a certified course, the issue was not technical preparation, but the certainty, that this was the area I wanted to invest in. There are great distance and classroom courses, it will depend on your time and your pocket.

### Do not try to learn everything at once ... 

There will be many new things that you will be crazy to learn, but focus on your trajectory, one day you will learn the advanced, but first you must learn the basics and do not be sad to see other people posting certificates or a resume of your dreams, the important thing is you and your determination.

### Mathematics ... 

This may be the part that hurts the most, but it will bring the best answers. With a simple Excel spreadsheet and a good knowledge of mathematics, you can be a good data scientist, but without math, even if you know how to work with various tools, you will be lost.

### Computing IT ... 

Focus on one tool at a time, don't be afraid of programming language it doesn't bite, face it, practice, the only way to learn and do.

### To finish ... 

If it is difficult it is good, because the more difficult, the more value your work will have, and less competition, of course!

Deceive anyone who thinks that the first Data Science project involves a series of professionals and a high investment. You can start in Data Science using your experiences to solve small problems in your company, using few resources and a lot of dedication

Good luck
